# Hangman Game

This is a simple hangman game that I created using Python. 
The game is played by guessing the letters of a word. 
The player has 6 chances to guess the word. 
If the player guesses the word correctly, they win the game. If the player runs out of chances, they lose the game.

## points to consider
- The game isn't case sensitive.
- The game check user input only one letter.
- The game will end when the user has guessed the word correctly or has run out of chances.
- The game will display the word if the user has run out of chances.

## sample output
